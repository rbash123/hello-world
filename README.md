#Writing about myself
I am a 5th year college student. Origionally I went to a community college and recieved some bad course guidance. With that situation, I ended up taking courses I did not need to; resulting in the need to take an extra year to fix the errors! After three years at community college, I got into Revelle college at UCSD and started as a junior!! Two years in and I am done at the end of this week! So exciting!! Graduating as, what I like to put it< a "super senior"!
